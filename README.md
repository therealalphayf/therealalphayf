# So... who am I?

**Hello!** My name is Alphayf (pronounced al-faif) and I am a beginner coder researching languages like Python and Lua. I am also interested in understanding and decompiling files and code from retro Playstation® games to preserve the future of long-lost titles.


# How can I contact you? 


If you want to send me a message, my Discord handle is **alphayf**. Talk to me about jailbreaking devices, Linux, or anything that comes to your mind. I am always happy to learn - or help!
